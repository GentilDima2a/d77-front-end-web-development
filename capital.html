                <ul>
                    <li>As of the most recent data (2023), Austin has an estimated population of approximately 1 million
                        people, making it the 11th most populous city in the United States and the largest city in Texas
                        after Houston.</li>
                    <li>Austin was officially incorporated as a city in 1839. It was selected to be the capital of the
                        Republic of Texas and became the state capital when Texas joined the Union in 1845.</li>
                    <li>Austin is located in Central Texas, which is part of the larger Hill Country region. The city
                        sits on the Colorado River (locally known as the Barton Creek), and it is geographically
                        positioned near the midpoint of the state.</li>
                    <li>Austin is classified as an urban city. It is known for its rapid growth and urban sprawl, but it
                        also has suburban neighborhoods surrounding the core city. Austin is an urban center, with a
                        vibrant downtown area, but some areas on the outskirts might be considered suburban.</li>
                    <li>Austin is known for having a relatively high average income level compared to the rest of Texas.
                        The higher income levels in Austin reflect its role as a technology hub (often referred to as
                        "Silicon Hills") and its appeal to highly educated professionals, including those in tech,
                        business, and creative industries.</li>
