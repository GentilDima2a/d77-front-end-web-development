        <h2>About Houston</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>As of the most recent estimates (2023), Houston has a population of approximately 2.3 million people,
            making it the largest city in Texas and the 4th-largest city in the United States. The Houston-The
            Woodlands-Sugar Land metropolitan area (also known as the Houston metro area) is the fifth-largest metro
            area in the U.S. with a population of over 7 million.</li>
          <li>Houston was officially incorporated on June 5, 1837. The city was founded in 1836 by John Kirby Allen and
            Augustus Chapman Allen, two real estate promoters from New York. It grew rapidly during the 19th century,
            driven by its location near the coast and the development of the port.</li>
          <li>Houston is located in Southeast Texas, near the Gulf of Mexico. It is part of the Upper Gulf Coast region
            and sits in the Prairie and Lakes region of Texas. The city is situated on the Buffalo Bayou, which connects
            to the larger Galveston Bay and the Gulf of Mexico, making it an important port city.</li>
          <li>Houston is classified as an urban city, and it is the largest urban center in Texas. The city itself has a
            highly developed downtown and is known for its sprawling neighborhoods, large commercial districts, and a
            highly diverse population. Houston is also the center of a large metropolitan area with numerous suburbs
            (such as Sugar Land, Katy, The Woodlands, and Cypress). The city has been described as having a combination
            of urban and suburban characteristics due to its rapid expansion in all directions, often referred to as a
            “postmodern city” because of its decentralized nature.</li>
          <li>The median household income in Houston is around $55,000 to $60,000 (2023), which is slightly below the
            state median of $64,000. However, Houston has a high level of income disparity across the city. While
            certain neighborhoods like River Oaks, Tanglewood, and West University Place feature very affluent residents
            with incomes well above the city average, there are also neighborhoods with much lower incomes, particularly
            in the southern and eastern parts of the city.</li>
