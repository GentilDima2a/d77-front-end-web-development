        <h2>About Dallas</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>As of the most recent estimates (2023), the population of Dallas is approximately 1.3 million people,
            making
            it the third-most populous city in Texas and the 9th-largest city in the United States. The Dallas-Fort
            Worth
            metropolitan area (DFW) has a population of around 7.7 million people, making it one of the largest metro
            areas in the country.</li>
          <li>Dallas was officially incorporated as a city on February 2, 1856. It began as a trading post and quickly
            grew due to its strategic location along the Trinity River, eventually becoming a major center for commerce,
            oil, and transportation.</li>
          <li>Dallas is located in North Texas, specifically in the Dallasâ€“Fort Worth metroplex. Geographically, it sits
            in the Piney Woods region of the state, but the city's landscape has been heavily developed, and much of its
            surrounding area consists of urban and suburban stretch</li>
          <li>Dallas is classified as an urban city. It is a major metropolitan center and part of the Dallas-Fort Worth
            metroplex, a sprawling urban area that includes many suburban cities like Arlington, Plano, and Irving.
            Dallas
            itself has a dense downtown area, with many high-rise buildings, and a broad network of suburbs extending
            outward.</li>
          <li>The median household income in Dallas is estimated to be around $60,000 to $65,000 (2023), which is
            slightly
            above the state average of $64,000 for Texas. But income levels can vary significantly among different
            neighborhoods in Dallas, while wealthier areas of the city such as Highland Park, University Park and parts
            of
            North Dallas have much higher incomes while other areas, particularly those in the southern and western
            parts
            of the city, have lower average incomes.</li>
